# docker-swarm-setup
this is a quick and dirty terraform template that spins up a couple vanilla ec2 instances with the underlying required cloud infra and then swarmifies those ec2 instances to create a docker swarm with distributed docker nodes.  this is meant to be a barebones setup in order to quickly deploy projects that require distributed containers and some basic container orchestration.  in the future i may add some automation here so that each each swarm node IP gets automatically added to an AWS discovery pool.  Then I would like to create an API Gateway resource via the terraform template that would point to this discovery pool, the result being the API Gateway will load balance among the swarm nodes without us having to update the config each time a new ec2 instances gets spun up.
